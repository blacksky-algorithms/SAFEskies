SAFEskies (Software Against a Fearful Environment) is a BlueSky feed management interface that enables secure moderation of custom feeds. Currently configured for the **Blacksky** feed generator with extensibility for other feeds.

**Requires** the [SAFEskies API](https://github.com/FreedomWriter/safe-skies-api) for backend operations.

**Live Application**: [www.safeskies.app](https://www.safeskies.app)

## ⚠️ Stability Warning

**IMPORTANT**: SAFEskies is currently in an alpha state of development. The application is functional but subject to significant changes as we work toward a stable release.

You should be aware of the following:

- The API and frontend interfaces may change without backward compatibility
- Data structures and storage mechanisms could be modified between versions
- Documentation is still evolving along with the application
- Deployment procedures might change as we stabilize the architecture

We encourage testing and feedback but recommend caution when using SAFEskies in production environments at this stage.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **npm** v9+ or **yarn** 1.22+
- **Backend API**: Running instance of [SAFEskies API](https://github.com/FreedomWriter/safe-skies-api)
- **BlueSky Account**: For authentication via OAuth

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FreedomWriter/SAFEskies.git
cd SAFEskies
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Configuration

### Create .env.local:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BSKY_BASE_API_URL=https://api.bsky.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_BSKY_BASE=https://bsky.social
NEXT_PUBLIC_SAFE_SKIES_API=http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Running the Application

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

## Usage

SAFEskies provides a user-friendly interface for managing and moderating BlueSky feeds. Here's how to get started:

### Authentication

1. Navigate to the application at [www.safeskies.app](https://www.safeskies.app)
2. Click "Sign in with BlueSky" to authenticate using your BlueSky account
3. Grant the requested permissions to allow SAFEskies to access your feed data

### Core Functions

- **View Feeds**: See all feeds you have permission to moderate
- **Moderation**: Remove posts that violate feed guidelines
- **User Management**: Admins can promote users to moderator status or remove their privileges
- **Audit Logs**: Review all moderation actions taken on your feeds

### Admin vs. Moderator Capabilities

- **Admins** (feed creators) can:

  - Manage moderator permissions
  - View complete audit logs
  - Access all moderation functions
  - Configure feed settings

- **Moderators** can:
  - Remove inappropriate posts
  - View their own moderation history
  - Access posts from managed feeds

For detailed usage instructions, please reference the [SAFEskies Documentation](https://github.com/FreedomWriter/SAFEskies/wiki) (coming soon).

## API Dependency

The frontend requires a running instance of the SAFEskies API for:

- OAuth authentication with BlueSky
- DID validation
- Role management
- Audit logging
- Feed configuration

## Security

### Critical Requirements

- Never expose Bluesky app passwords in client code
- Use HTTPS in production
- Rotate credentials quarterly
- Validate DIDs on both client and API

### Secure Practices

```bash
# Audit dependencies
npm audit

# Update packages
npm update --audit
```

## Contributing

SAFEskies welcomes community contributions, but please note our current development phase focuses on establishing stability before implementing major new features.

### Current Contribution Priorities

- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- Documentation improvements
- Accessibility enhancements
- Test coverage expansion

### Contribution Process

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Review open issues to see if your concern is already being addressed.

2. **Open an Issue First**: Before submitting code changes, please open an issue to discuss your proposed changes.

   - For bugs, include reproduction steps and expected behavior
   - For features, explain the use case and implementation approach

3. **Development Workflow**:

   ```bash
   # Fork and clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SAFEskies.git
   cd SAFEskies

   # Create a descriptive feature branch
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description

   # Install dependencies
   npm install

   # Make your changes with tests
   # Run tests to ensure no regressions
   npm test
   ```

4. **Code Standards**:

   - Follow existing code style patterns
   - Include comments for complex logic
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation to reflect changes

5. **Pull Request Process**:
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Reference the related issue in your PR
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Be responsive to review feedback

The maintainer will review PRs on a regular basis, prioritizing stability-focused contributions during this alpha development phase.
